# GBA repro patches

Collection of batteryless patches for chinese repro cartridges to save inside the rom

I want to restructure the whole repo as by now important information for the patches are missing. fe chip, board revision and so on.

For contributions please provide the following:

- Picture of the Cartridge board
- Information in txt about the chips
- patchfile
- GBC - method is required see [README](https://github.com/acocalypso/batteryless-patches/blob/main/patches/GBC/README.md)

It can be zipped and sent by PR.
